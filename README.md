# My Lazy Nvim Configuration


Refer to the [lazynvim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
Don't forget to install lua and any nerd font you like. Then in your terminal of choice, select that font as default. Otherwise the icons won't be visible.

P.S. I like to alias vi='vim'. 
happy vi-ing.

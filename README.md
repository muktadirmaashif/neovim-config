# My Lazy Nvim Configuration

## installation

Install [Nvim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/blob/master/INSTALL.md) from here. 
Then, 
```bash
# required
mv ~/.config/nvim{,.bak}

# optional but recommended
mv ~/.local/share/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.local/state/nvim{,.bak}
mv ~/.cache/nvim{,.bak}

# Clone the starter

git clone https://github.com/muktadirmaashif/neovim-config ~/.config/nvim

# Remove the .git folder, so you can add it to your own repo later

rm -rf ~/.config/nvim/.git

# Start Neovim!

nvim
```

Refer to the [lazynvim documentation](https://lazyvim.github.io/installation) to get started.
## Points to be noded

* Don't forget to install lua programming language and any nerd font you like. Then in your terminal of choice, select that font as default. Otherwise the icons won't be visible.


P.S. I like to alias vi='vim'. 

happy vi-ing.
